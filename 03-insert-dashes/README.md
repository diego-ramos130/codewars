## PD 
write a function that takes in a number and returns a string of that number with dashes between odd numbers. 

## DESCRIPT
Write a function insertDash(num)/InsertDash(int num) that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number.
